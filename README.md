# PDFeasy---Online-pdf-converter. It can otherwise be called as PDFgo. It initially converts image files to PDF, where users can choose their own way of customizing the page formats and page margins, and no. of images per file. After uploading, users can manually sort the files and convert. Note this is primarily a client side solution, where user's can directly get their conversions done without uploading the files to server. This project can have more enhancements and can be updated to accept other file formats and convert them to PDF.
